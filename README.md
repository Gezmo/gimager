Get Images Remotely
This API functions as an image keeper.
It stores images supplied in bulk through text files containing the online URL's to the images.
It supplies a list of metadata of all available images.
It returns a single image URL when requested using the stored URL if still availble or the URL of the local copy if the original file is no longer available.
